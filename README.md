# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

It was interesting project, however would be better if tasks would be more clear, sometimes I could not understand what I have to do and went on Doscord to clear it out with tutors.
